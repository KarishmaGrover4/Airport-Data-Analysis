# Airport Data Analysis

Developed Airport and Airline data analysis dashboard.


## Acknowledgements

Airport data analytics for San Francisco help to unleash key information and knowledge that help to address many of the key areas where airports and aviatation facility face challenges. These areas extend to almost every facet of airport processes, from purely operational ones â€“ such as airport resource usage optimization, maintenance, and airport capacity â€“ to nonâ€“aeronautical revenue intensification and passenger experience maximization.

## Problem Statement

Prepare a project to identify where the various flights from San Francisco Airport are flying and which are the busiest and most lengthy routes from the airport. Also, create a hidden filter within the dashboard. Find key metrics and factors that show meaningful relationships between different attributes.
## About Data

For this project, we used data from the San Francisco Airport for March 2020. To proceed we have taken the important aspects like Coordinates, Route, Date, Base Airline, Terminal (Gate No.), Actual time, and Estimated time. In order to get data for the Airport and Airlines we have added the dataset for Airport information (City, IATA, Country, Name, Code). Using this information, we have figured most common destinations that were frequent from San Francisco, the busiest route covered along with the distance covered during those flights.
